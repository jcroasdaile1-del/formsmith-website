      question: "What does Formsmith Custom Forms build?",
      answer:
        "Formsmith Custom Forms builds practical custom business software such as customer managers, scheduling tools, quote and job trackers, inventory systems, operational forms, dashboards, reports, document workflows, and Google Sheets-powered business apps. The exact screens and features are shaped around the way each business works."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is Formsmith Custom Forms for?",
      answer:
        "Formsmith Custom Forms is focused on small businesses, solo entrepreneurs, contractors, local service companies, and teachers who have outgrown spreadsheets, paper forms, or a collection of disconnected tools. Businesses with larger teams are welcome to request a quote so the scope can be evaluated."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you replace my spreadsheet?",
      answer:
        "Often, yes. A spreadsheet may be a good starting point because it shows the information and calculations your business already relies on. Formsmith can review the current process and determine which parts make sense to move into a clearer custom system. Some spreadsheets may remain useful alongside the new workflow."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to know exactly what I want before contacting you?",
      answer:
        "No. It is enough to explain what is slowing you down, what tools you use now, and what you wish were easier. The quote process is designed to help map the workflow before a solution and scope are proposed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I try a demo?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The Demos page links to interactive examples that use fictional sample information. They are intended to demonstrate possible workflows and interface ideas, not off-the-shelf products or completed client results."
    },
    {
      question: "Is every project custom?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Formsmith may reuse reliable design patterns and development approaches, but the workflow, terminology, screens, fields, and priorities are selected for the individual project rather than forced into a generic template."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a project cost?",
      answer:
        "There is no minimum project price. Smaller starting points and focused demos are welcome, and each project is quoted individually based on the workflow, screens, data, automation, reporting, mobile use, revisions, and support involved. If a larger idea needs to be divided into focused phases, that will be discussed before work begins. Any third-party service or optional ongoing-support costs will be identified separately. The initial quote request is free."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a project take?",
      answer:
        "Timing depends on the size of the workflow, the readiness of existing information, revision needs, and any integrations. Formsmith will discuss an estimated schedule after reviewing the request; a completion date is not guaranteed until the project scope and terms are agreed."
    },
    {
      question: "Will the software work on mobile devices?",
      answer:
        "Mobile-friendly use can be included as a project priority. The specific devices, screen sizes, connectivity needs, and workflows should be discussed during scoping so the proposed approach fits how the software will be used."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work with my existing Google Sheets data?",
      answer:
        "Potentially. Existing Google Sheets files can help explain the current workflow, and some projects may use Sheets as a data source or import existing rows. Formsmith will need to review the structure and quality of the data before confirming an import or integration approach."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide revisions?",
      answer:
        "Revision and feedback rounds can be included in a project proposal. The number, timing, and scope of revisions will be defined before work begins so expectations are clear."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I own my business data?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You will own your business data. The project agreement will document how you can access or export it, along with any project-specific storage or third-party service responsibilities."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I own the software and source code?",
      answer:
        "Your business data belongs to you. Ownership or licensing of the application, source code, reusable Formsmith components, and handoff materials is a separate matter that will be stated clearly in the project agreement before work begins."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Formsmith provide support after launch?",
      answer:
        "Post-launch support may be available depending on the project. Any included support period, maintenance work, response expectations, and ongoing costs will be described in the proposal or a separate support arrangement."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you build software for an industry not listed on the site?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The listed industries are examples, not limits. If a business has a repeatable process, scattered information, or a spreadsheet that has become difficult to manage, Formsmith can review the workflow and determine whether a custom system is a practical fit."
